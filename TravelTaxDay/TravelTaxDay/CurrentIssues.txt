Known Issues:
When user location is changed (phone moves), and add stay at current location is pressed the location does not correctly update until a 2nd press (Or the app is closed)

When a the only stay is deleted from a location, the location disappears as expected, however after adding a new stay to the same location, the location appears again, but the stay does not (until the app is closed)
    Improved to update when the page is refreshed (the stay also appears in the country)

Currently no way to edit stays at a location, only to delete them

Currently no way to automatically add stays at current location (supposed to check every x hours) (In progress as background task)
